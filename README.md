# Meet me (backend)

> The frontend part can be found [here](https://github.com/ahatovicemira/Meet-me-frontend).

This is the backend part of my little two-part application. The project was written in Node js and used Heroku for easier deployment. The project was made as part of a University course. The goal was to learn some basics of Node js and web communication.
